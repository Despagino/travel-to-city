# travel-to-city

A work in progress. The main goal of this website is to give information about the city that you plan on going to or just waondering what that city is like at the moment. My next plan for this project is to have 4 buttons pop on the screen once you press enter. Those 4 buttons will indicate "Covid Status", "Weather", "Places to go to", "Plane tickets". I am learning React at the moment and this will help with the project moving forward.
